      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>Brighton ALT NET is a monthly get together for anyone interested in C# and .NET development. We meet at <a href="https://www.werksgroup.org.uk/portfolio/werks-central/">The Werks Central (Middle Street)</a> on the second Thursday of every month at 7.15 pm. It's free. There's no need to register or book, just turn up. We've been going for around ten years.</p>
      <p>It's very informal. Usually around ten to twenty people turn up. We have a pile of post-it notes and at the beginning of the evening we write down stuff we'd like to talk about. We then vote on the topics and talk about them in descending vote order, 15 minutes per question until 9 and then 5 minutes per question until the end. We are usually finished by 9.30.</p>
      <p>It's a really friendly crowd and everyone is welcome.</p>
      <p>This site is administered by Steve Hughes, please contact <a href="mailto:steve@ubersteve.com">steve@ubersteve.com</a> for more information.</p>
