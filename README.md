GitHub Pages uses the Jekyll blogging engine to automatically generate the content for the site. To develop changes locally you can use the included `docker-compose` file. Docker compose is installed by default on Windows and MacOS. For Linux follow the instructions on the docker site.

To start the server run `docker-compose up` at the command line. This will retrieve the image and start the server.

When you are done press `Ctrl-c` to exit the process.
